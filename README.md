# Hacker News Best Stories API

This project exposes a RESTful API using **ASP.NET Core (.NET 9)** that retrieves the **best N stories from the Hacker News API**, ordered by score.

---

## Purpose
The API must:
- Retrieve the **best stories** (`amount` defined by the caller).
- Return them sorted by **score** in descending order.
- Be **resilient and efficient**, avoiding overload of both our API and the external Hacker News API.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Caching
- Implemented **MemoryCache** to avoid calling Hacker News API on every request.
- Prepared the architecture to easily switch to **Redis** (for distributed cache in production).
- Cache reduces latency and improves API responsiveness.

### ‚úÖ Resilience with Polly
- **Retry with exponential backoff** ‚Üí 200ms ‚Üí 400ms ‚Üí 800ms, when Hacker News is unstable.
- **Circuit Breaker** ‚Üí prevents overwhelming an external service already failing, by opening the circuit after repeated errors.

### ‚úÖ Rate Limiting
- **Native .NET Rate Limiting Middleware**: protects our API by limiting inbound requests (per IP, per user, per API key).
- Ensures **fair usage** and prevents abuse.

### ‚úÖ External Rate Limiter
- Custom limiter applied before making calls to Hacker News.
- Ensures our application never exceeds a safe request threshold against the upstream API.
- Prevents our service from being blocked or throttled by Hacker News.

### ‚úÖ Health Checks
- `/health` endpoint exposes application health in JSON format.
- Checks:
  - Our API process.
  - External Hacker News API availability.
  - Memory cache availability.

## Why this matters

By combining:
- **Cache** (avoid redundant external calls),
- **Polly Retry Policies** (recover from transient failures),
- **Circuit Breaker** (stop hammering when external service is down),
- **Native Rate Limiter** (protect our API from being overloaded),
- **External Rate Limiter** (avoid overloading Hacker News),

üëâ we guarantee that:
- **Our API will not be overloaded by high traffic.**
- **The Hacker News API will not be overloaded by us.**
- **Users experience consistent performance and reliability.**

## Architecture (Clean Architecture Style)

The solution follows a layered architecture:

```bash
/src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Api
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Controllers -> Expose REST endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Services -> Business logic (cache, ordering, orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HttpClients -> HackerNews HttpClient with Polly policies
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RateLimiting -> Internal & external rate limiters
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cache -> MemoryCache (ready for Redis)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Entities -> Core domain models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Contracts (Shared)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DTOs -> Data transfer objects
```


- **Controllers** ‚Üí entrypoints (REST API).  
- **Services** ‚Üí orchestrate business logic (get IDs, fetch stories, apply cache, sort).  
- **Clients** ‚Üí isolated typed HttpClient for Hacker News.  
- **DTOs** ‚Üí input/output models.  
- **Domain** ‚Üí core entity models.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/brunoverc/HackerNews.BestStories.git

cd hackernews-beststories

# run the API
dotnet run --project src/HackerNews.BestStories.Api
```

Then navigate to:

Swagger UI ‚Üí https://localhost:5001/swagger

Health check ‚Üí https://localhost:5001/health

Example call ‚Üí https://localhost:5001/api/v1/stories/bests/{amount}

## ‚úÖ Example Response

```bash
[
  {
    "title": "A uBlock Origin update was rejected from the Chrome Web Store",
    "uri": "https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745",
    "postedBy": "ismaildonmez",
    "time": "2019-10-12T13:43:01+00:00",
    "score": 1716,
    "commentCount": 572
  }
]
```

## Future Improvements

- Switch from MemoryCache ‚Üí Redis for distributed environments.

- Add OpenTelemetry for logs, metrics and traces (Prometheus + Grafana).

- Add Dockerfile & docker-compose for local development and observability stack.

- Improve integration tests for rate limiting and circuit breaker behavior.

- Implement background cache refresh to keep stories updated proactively.
